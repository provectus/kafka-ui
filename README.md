<em>UI for Apache Kafka is a free, open-source web UI to monitor and manage Apache Kafka clusters. </em> 

UI for Apache Kafka is a simple tool that makes your data flows observable, helps find and troubleshoot issues faster and deliver optimal performance. Its lightweight dashboard makes it easy to track key metrics of your Kafka clusters - Brokers, Topics, Partitions, Production, and Consumption. 

Set up UI for Apache Kafka with just a couple of easy commands to visualize your Kafka data in a comprehensible way. You can run the tool locally or in the cloud.

# Getting Started

To run UI for Apache Kafka, you can use a pre-built Docker image or build it locally.  

## Running From Docker Image
The official Docker image for UI for Apache Kafka is hosted here: [hub.docker.com/r/provectuslabs/kafka-ui](https://hub.docker.com/r/provectuslabs/kafka-ui).

Launch Docker container in the background:
```sh

docker run -p 8080:8080 \
	-e KAFKA_CLUSTERS_0_NAME=local \
	-e KAFKA_CLUSTERS_0_BOOTSTRAPSERVERS=kafka:9092 \
	-d provectuslabs/kafka-ui:latest 

```
Then access the web UI at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).  
Further configuration with environment variables - [see environment variables](#env_variables)  
 
### Docker Compose

If you prefer to use `docker-compose` please refer to the [documentation](docker-compose.md).


## Building With Docker

Steps to build UI for Apache Kafka locally with Docker:  

1. Install prerequisites: Java and Docker
2. Clone this repository and open a terminal in the directory of the project
3. Build a Docker container with UI for Apache Kafka
4. Start UI for Apache Kafka with your Kafka clusters
5. Navigate to UI for Apache Kafka 

### Prerequisites

* Java 13 or newer
* Docker 

### Installing Prerequisites on Mac
1. Install Homebrew Cask:
```sh
> brew update
``` 
2. Install JAVA 13 with Homebrew Cask:
```sh
> brew tap adoptopenjdk/openjdk
> brew install adoptopenjdk13
``` 
### Building

Once you installed the prerequisites and cloned the repository, run the following commands in your project directory: 

Build a Docker container with UI for Apache Kafka: 
```sh
./mvnw clean install -Pprod
``` 
Start UI for Apache Kafka with your Kafka clusters: 
```sh
docker-compose -f ./docker/kafka-ui.yaml up
``` 
To see UI for Apache Kafka, navigate to http://localhost:8080.

If you want to start only kafka-clusters: 
```sh
docker-compose -f ./docker/kafka-clusters-only.yaml up
``` 
Then start UI for Apache Kafka with a **local** profile. 

## Running Locally Without Docker

```sh
./mvnw spring-boot:run -Pprod
``` 


## Running in Kubernetes
``` bash
helm repo add kafka-ui https://provectus.github.io/kafka-ui
helm install kafka-ui kafka-ui/kafka-ui
```

## Connecting to a Secure Broker

UI for Apache Kafka supports TLS (SSL) and SASL connections for [encryption and authentication](http://kafka.apache.org/090/documentation.html#security). This can be configured by providing a combination of the following files (placed into the Kafka root directory):

To be continued


# Configuration

We have plenty of docker-compose files as examples. Please check them out in ``docker`` directory.

## Configuration File
Example of how to configure clusters in the [application-local.yml](https://github.com/provectus/kafka-ui/blob/master/kafka-ui-api/src/main/resources/application-local.yml) configuration file:


```sh
kafka:
  clusters:
    -
      name: local
      bootstrapServers: localhost:29091
      zookeeper: localhost:2183
      schemaRegistry: http://localhost:8085
      schemaRegistryAuth:
        username: username
        password: password
#     schemaNameTemplate: "%s-value"
      jmxPort: 9997
    -
```    

* `name`: cluster name
* `bootstrapServers`: where to connect
* `zookeeper`: zookeeper service address
* `schemaRegistry`: schemaRegistry's address
* `schemaRegistryAuth.username`: schemaRegistry's basic authentication username
* `schemaRegistryAuth.password`: schemaRegistry's basic authentication password
* `schemaNameTemplate`: how keys are saved to schemaRegistry
* `jmxPort`: open jmxPosrts of a broker
* `readOnly`: enable read only mode

Configure as many clusters as you need by adding their configs below separated with `-`.

## <a name="env_variables"></a> Environment Variables

Alternatively, each variable of the .yml file can be set with an environment variable. 
For example, if you want to use an environment variable to set the `name` parameter, you can write it like this: `KAFKA_CLUSTERS_2_NAME`
